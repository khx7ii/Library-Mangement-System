# Library Management System 

## Overview
The Library Management System is a web-based application built using the .NET MVC framework, designed to efficiently manage library resources while providing a user-friendly platform for library members. The system enables users to search, borrow, and manage books online, while administrators oversee library operations.

## Users have the ability to:
• Borrow books for a day, with an easy option to return them when finished.
• Leave comments on books, sharing their thoughts and reviews with other readers.
• View any applicable late fees calculated automatically by the system, ensuring they are informed of any charges.

## Admins have access to powerful management tools, allowing them to:
• Add, update, and remove books and categories in the library’s collection.
• Track and monitor all user activity, including book checkouts, returns, and comments.
 •Assign admin roles to other users, providing flexible options for managing library operations efficiently.


This system is designed to support the needs of both users and admins, creating a modern, digital library experience.
